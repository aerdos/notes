# notes
A collection of my Jupyter Notebooks I've written, mostly for myself. The goal was to be practical and concicse, these are in no way theoretically comprehensive.

[**FIR Filter**](https://github.com/aerdos/notes/blob/master/FIR%20Filter.ipynb)
A practical description of the FIR Filter with design and implementation examples.

[**Exponential Filter as an IIR Filter**](https://github.com/aerdos/notes/blob/master/Exponential%20Filter%20as%20an%20IIR%20Filter.ipynb) Describes the mathematical relationship between the commonly used Exponential filter and the IIR Filter. Includes frequency domain and step response analysis.
