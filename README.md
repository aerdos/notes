# notes
A collection of my Jupyter Notebooks that I've written as notes for myself.

[**Exponential Filter as an IIR Filter**](https://github.com/aerdos/notes/blob/master/Exponential%20Filter%20as%20an%20IIR%20Filter.ipynb) Describes the mathematical relationship between the commonly used Exponential filter and the IIR Filter. Shows how to do frequency domain and step response analysis using Python.
